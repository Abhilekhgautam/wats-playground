# Online Wats Playground
This is an online playground for [The Wats Programming Language](https://github.com/Abhilekhgautam/wats).

The compiler is written in C++, which is later compiled to wasm and loaded on the web. This language aims to improve error reporting in compilers, so look out for error messages while running your code.

**Note**: *The wats compiler is currently under development and I plan to update the wasm build every day at least with some minor update.*
